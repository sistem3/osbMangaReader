# OsbMangaReader

## Synopsis:

[Angular JS](https://angular.io/) Application for reading Manga, powered by [MangaScraper API](https://market.mashape.com/doodle/manga-scraper) with content powered by [MangaReader.net](https://www.mangareader.net) (for now, will expand to other sources later). At the moment I am working on the Bookmarking system to allow users to jump around bookmarked pages within a Manga, I am also looking to create a wrapper in Electron to create a desktop application.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.2.

## Demo: [Click Here](https://osbmangareader.firebaseapp.com/)

## Dependencies:
* [Angular 4](https://angular.io/)
* [Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com)
* [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io)
* [iDangerous Swiper](http://idangero.us/swiper/)
* [ScrollMagic](http://scrollmagic.io/)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
